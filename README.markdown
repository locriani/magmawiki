Please note: we've decided to rewrite Magmawiki from scratch, if you wish to see older versions of Magmawiki, please check the develop branch.

What is Magmawiki?
==================

Magmawiki is an open source (MIT licence) wiki engine.  It is currently a work in progress.  The goal is to eventually replace Mediawiki (which powers the Dwarf Fortress wiki) with something considerably more stable, user-friendly, maintainable, and extensible. It currently supports most of the Mediawiki markup language (via. WikiCloth), and will eventually feature a better templating system, scripting, and some other goodies. It will also be able to import existing Mediawiki installations.

Contributions
=============

Contributions to Magmawiki make us happy.

We discuss Magmawiki on freenode irc at #magmawiki, feel free to stop in and join us in discussions about the duckbilled prematureoptimizationadon, Starcraft 2, Sesame Street, and occasionally Magmawiki development!

Please note that we don't use the Master branch any longer for development work; instead, it references a stable codebase (usually releases).  We use the [git-flow workflow][1] to help ensure we don't go too insane.

We can not recommend the use of Magmawiki in a production environment at this time.
